abstract: >-
  UQTestFuns is an open-source Python3 library of test
  functions commonly used within the uncertainty
  quantification (UQ) community. The package aims to provide
  a lightweight implementation (with minimal dependencies)
  of many test functions available in the UQ literature,
  a single entry point (combining models and their
  probabilistic input specification) to a wide range of test
  functions, and an opportunity for an open-source contribution
  where new test functions and reference results are posted.
