# Obtaining and Installing UQTestFuns

You can obtain UQTestFuns directly from PyPI using `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install uqtestfuns
```

Alternatively, you can also install the latest version from the source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/damar-wicaksono/uqtestfuns.git
```

> **NOTE**: UQTestFuns is currently work in progress,
> therefore interfaces are subject to change.

It's a good idea to install the package in an isolated virtual environment.
