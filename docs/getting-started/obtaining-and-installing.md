# Obtaining and Installing UQTestFuns

You can obtain UQTestFuns directly from PyPI using `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install uqtestfuns
```

Alternatively, you can also install the latest version from the source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/damar-wicaksono/uqtestfuns.git
```

```{important}
UQTestFuns is currently a work in progress,
therefore the interfaces are subject to change, at least until v1.0.0
is finally released.
```

It's a good idea to install the package in an isolated virtual environment.
