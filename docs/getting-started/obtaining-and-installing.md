# Obtaining and Installing UQTestFuns

UQTestFuns is still under pre-release development;
it is therefore not yet available via PyPI.
The source is hosted in GitHub and can be obtained via:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/casus/uqtestfuns
```

To install the package from source, type:

```bash
$ pip install [-e] .
```
where the optional flag `-e` tells `pip` to link the package source as obtained
via `git` into the Python site-packages.

It's often a good idea to install the package
in an isolated Python virtual environment.
