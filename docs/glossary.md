CDF
    Cumulative distribution function, denoted by $F_X(x; \circ)$ where $\circ$
    is a placeholder for the distribution parameter(s).

ICDF
    Inverse cumulative distribution function, denoted by $F^{-1}_X(x; \circ)$
    where $\circ$ is a placeholder for the distribution parameter(s).
    The domain of ICDF is $(0, 1)$. Depending on the distribution
    and its parameter values, the value at the boundaries may or may not be
    finite.
    ICDF is also known as the _quantile function_
    or _percent point function_.

PDF
    Probability density function, denoted by $f_X(x; \circ)$ where $\circ$
    is a placeholder for the distribution parameter(s).

Support
    The support of the probability density function, that is, the subset of 
    the function domain whose elements are not mapped to zero;
    denoted by $\mathcal{D}_X$.
