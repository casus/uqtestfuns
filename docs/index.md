# Welcome to the UQTestFuns documentation!

UQTestFuns is an open-source Python3 library of test functions commonly used
within the applied uncertainty quantification (UQ) community.
The package aims to provide:

- a _lightweight implementation_ (with minimal dependencies)
  of many test functions available in the UQ literature
- a _single entry point_ (combining models and their probabilistic input 
  specification) to a wide range of test functions
- an _opportunity for an open-source contribution_ where new test functions and
  reference results are posted.

New to, but ready to use, UQTestFuns?
You can check out the guide on how to create a built-in test function
or a custom one.
Need some background info first?
Check out the what & why of these test functions.

Be sure to browse through all the available test functions in UQTestFuns;
they are also crudely classified into their usage in typical UQ analyses.
Need a reference on how to define a probabilistic input model,
there's a dedicated section on that!
