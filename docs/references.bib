  volume   = {204},
  abstract = {Comparison studies of global sensitivity analysis (GSA) approaches are limited in that they are performed on a single model or a small set of test functions, with a limited set of sample sizes and dimensionalities. This work introduces a ﬂexible ‘metafunction’ framework to benchmarking which randomly generates test problems of varying dimensionality and functional form using random combinations of plausible basis functions, and a range of sample sizes. The metafunction is tuned to mimic the characteristics of real models, in terms of the type of model response and the proportion of active model inputs. To demonstrate the framework, a comprehensive comparison of ten GSA approaches is performed in the screening setting, considering functions with up to 100 dimensions and up to 1000 model runs. The methods examined range from recent metamodelling approaches to elementary eﬀects and Monte Carlo estimators of the Sobol’ total eﬀect index. The results give a comparison in unprecedented depth, and show that on average and in the setting investigated, Monte Carlo estimators, particularly the VARS estimator, outperform metamodels. Indicatively, metamodels become competitive at around 10–20 runs per model input, but at lower ratios sampling-based approaches are more eﬀective as a screening tool.},

  title    = {Design and analysis of computer experiments for screening input variables},

  abstract = {A computer model is a computer code that implements a mathematical model of a physical process. A computer code is often complicated and can involve a large number of inputs, so it may take hours or days to produce a single response. Screening to determine the most active inputs is critical for reducing the number of future code runs required to understand the detailed input-output relationship, since the computer model is typically complex and the exact functional form of the input-output relationship is unknown. This dissertation proposes a new screening method that identifies active inputs in a computer experiment setting. It describes a Bayesian computation of sensitivity indices as screening measures. It provides algorithms for generating desirable designs for successful screening.

The proposed screening method is called GSinCE (Group Screening in Computer Experiments). The GSinCE procedure is based on a two-stage group screening approach, in which groups of inputs are investigated in the first stage and then inputs within only those groups identified as active at the first stage are investigated individually at the second stage. Two-stage designs with desirable properties are constructed to implement the procedure. Sensitivity indices are used to measure the effects of inputs on the response. Inputs with large sensitivity indices are determined by comparison with a benchmark null distribution constructed from user-specified, low-impact inputs. The use of low-impact inputs is useful for screening out inputs having small effects as well as those that are totally inert. Simulated examples show that, compared with one-stage procedures, the GSinCE procedure provides accurate screening while reducing computational effort.

In this dissertation, the sensitivity indices used as screening measures are computed in a Gaussian process model framework. This approach is known to be computationally efficient by using small numbers of expensive computer code runs for the estimation of sensitivity indices. The existing approach for quantitative inputs is extended so that sensitivity indices can be computed when inputs include a qualitative input in addition to quantitative inputs.

An orthogonal design in which the design matrix has uncorrelated columns is important for estimating the effects of inputs. Moreover, a space-filling design for which design points are well spread out is needed to explore the experimental region thoroughly. New algorithms for achieving such orthogonal space-filling designs are proposed in this dissertation. The three kinds of software are provided for the proposed GSinCE procedure, computation of sensitivity indices, and design search algorithms.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a deterministic uncertainty analysis (DUA) method for calculating uncertainties that has the potential to significantly reduce the number of computer runs compared to conventional statistical analysis. The method is based upon the availability of derivative and sensitivity data such as that calculated using the well known direct or adjoint sensitivity analysis techniques. Formation of response surfaces using derivative data and the propagation of input probability distributions are discussed relative to their role in the DUA method. A sample problem that models the flow of water through a borehole is used as a basis to compare the cumulative distribution function of the flow rate as calculated by the standard statistical methods and the DUA method. Propogation of uncertainties by the DUA method is compared for ten cases in which the number of reference model runs was varied from one to ten. The DUA method gives a more accurate representation of the true cumulative distribution of the flow rate based upon as few as two model executions compared to fifty model executions using a statistical approach.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we propose a new formulation of gradient-enhanced universal Kriging that uses sparse polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) as trend functions. In this regard, the gradient information is used to improve both the trend function and the Gaussian process part. The optimal set of polynomial terms is selected based on the least angle regression algorithm. We tested the performance of the posed gradient-enhanced polynomial chaos Kriging (GEPCK) in several algebraic and non-algebraic test cases and compared it with ordinary Kriging (OK) and ordinary gradient-enhanced Kriging (GEK). Results show that GEPCK consistently outperformed other methods or at least competitive to the best performing method on both algebraicand non-algebraic problems. This indicates that the performance of the conventional GEK can be further improved by incorporating sparse PCE as trend functions.},
